## üöÄ Installation and Setup Guide

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the project from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.gitcd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Set up the Backend

First, navigate to the `backend` folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` folder and enter your PostgreSQL database connection information.

**`backend/.env`**
```env
# Database connection info
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=storetrack

# Port the server runs on
PORT=3001
```

**Important Note:** Make sure to create a database named `storetrack` (or your preferred name) in PostgreSQL.

#### Run the Backend Server
```bash
 npm start
```
Your backend server is now running at `http://localhost:3001`.

### 3. Set up the Frontend

In a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the dependencies.
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Set the API Address

The frontend needs to know the address of the backend API. To do this, create a `.env` file in the root of the `frontend` folder.

**`frontend/.env`**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

#### Run the Frontend Application

```bash
npm start
```
After running this command, the application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
